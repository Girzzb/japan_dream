## Variables are "boxes" that store data, such as numbers or text.

Python has main data types:

- int: Integer numbers (e.g., 16, 0, -5)
- float: Decimal numbers (e.g., 1.75, 3.14)
- str: Text strings (e.g., "adomx", "Japan")
- bool: Boolean values (True, False)

You don't need to predefine types; Python handles it automatically.

## Python: Conditional Statements

- if: Checks the first condition
- elif: Checks the next condition if the previous one is false
- else: Executes if no previous condition is true

## Python: Loops

- for: Repeats a specified number of times (e.g., range(1, 6) = 1 to 5)
- while: Repeats as long as the condition is true

## Exercise 1: BMI

- Input weight and height
- Calculate BMI = weight / (height \* height)
- Use if/elif/else to evaluate BMI

## Exercise 1: BMI (using cm)

- Change input to Height (cm)
- Convert cm to m by dividing height_cm by 100
- BMI formula remains the same, but use height_m
