## Python

- Learned lists: sum(), len(), max() for calculations
- Learned dictionaries: key-value pairs, items() for iteration
- Exercises:
  - Exercise 1: Calculate average of a list (used sum(), len())
  - Exercise 2: Find maximum in a list (used max(), learned loop alternative)
  - Exercise 3: Count character frequency (used dictionary)
  - Exercise 4: Count word frequency (used dictionary and items())

## Git

- Learned branching: git branch, git checkout
- Created branch feature/day3 for Day 3 exercises
